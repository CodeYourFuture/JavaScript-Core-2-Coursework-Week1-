/**

The Reading List
Keep track of which books you've read and which books you want to read!

=====
Exercise 1
=====


Loop through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and book author like so: 

"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien"

You should write and log at least 5 books

=====
Exercise 2
=====
Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you have read it yet or not. 

If you've read it, log a string like 'You've already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien', 
and if not, log a string like 'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'
